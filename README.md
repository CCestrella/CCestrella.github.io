## Project Requirements

### Content
- [ ] Biography (at least 100 words): For the biography section, I included a brief background about myself along with photos in a carousel format. This choice was made to highlight my experience with the She Codes 1-Day Workshop event, complemented by a formal portrait.
     #### About Me Page

- [ ] Functional Contact Form: I added required fields to the contact form, ensuring that users must provide their name and email before submitting. This is important because it helps me ensure that I can follow up with users effectively and reduces the likelihood of receiving incomplete or anonymous inquiries. 
       #### Contact Page

- [ ] "Projects" section:  I organized my projects into three categories to better showcase my transferable skills across different areas. This approach was inspired by pricing tables used by SaaS companies, which effectively categorize and present information.
     #### Projects Page

- [ ] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn: I included links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles at the bottom of the home page for desktop view. On mobile devices, these links move to the upper right of the screen. This layout makes it convenient for users to access my social profiles regardless of the device they are using.
